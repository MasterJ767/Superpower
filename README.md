Superpower
==========

This is a work-in-progress game where I am yet to decide the genre and full direciton of the game. So far I have some ideas for a character and a range of classes where the player has the ability to manipulate different elements such as Fire, Ice, Earth, Plants, Electricity etc. But the idea is not much more fleshed out than that.

As things stand there is a player in the game who has access to a couple of abilities from one of the element classes (Time). This player can be moved aorund the scene: walking, running and jumping.

How to Use
-----------

Open the game in Unity. Use the WASD keys to move the player and mouse to rotate and zoom with the camera. Pressing buttons 1 - 5 allows you to switch between your five abilites. The player also has a basic attack which is the default attack selected and can be reselect with Q or by pressing buttons 1 - 5 when attack 1 - 5 are already selected.  

Built With
