Superpower
==========

This is a work-in-progress game where I am yet to decide the genre and full direciton of the game. So far I have some ideas for a character and a range of classes where the player has the ability to manipulate different elements such as Fire, Ice, Earth, Plants, Electricity etc. But the idea is not much more fleshed out than that.
